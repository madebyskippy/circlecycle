# circlecycle
Adjust connected circles to create hypnotizing spirals and get the cycle to hit the targets.

Control the circle sizes of a spirograph to create patterns, shapes, and hit targets.

Made to show at NYSCI for the class Designing for Kids. Intended to pair with a set of physical alt controlers so multiple people can interact at once.
